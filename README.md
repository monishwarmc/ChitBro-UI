## ChitBro

A decentralised Chit-Fund app that cannot involve in fraud even if it wants to.

### Tech Stack:

* Frontend - React, Redux, SCSS
* Blockchain - Polygon(previously Matic)
* Smart Contracts - Solidity

### Deployment

* Smart Contract code deployed on Matic Mumbai
  Testnet [0x9a9f80E47e8D67D526e21A09aF1e385b0f7F88be](https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/address/0x9a9f80E47e8D67D526e21A09aF1e385b0f7F88be)
* Frontend written in React deployed on Firebase - [chitbro.web.app](https://chitbro.web.app)

### Local

* To start frontend connected to Matic test net, run `npm start`
* Smart Contract available on `contracts/ChitManager.sol` folder of this project
* ABI for the contract is at `src/TextNetwork.js`

### Uniqueness from other similar projects

* There are similar solutions that implement ChitFund on a blockchain, but they use blockchain only for securing and not
  crypto assets. For example: [chitmonks](chitmonks.com)
* DeFi platforms like [pooltogether](pooltogether.com),[aave](aave.com) are DeFi borrowing, lending, pooling protocols
  whereas Chit Funds are an Indian concept which is being democratized for the entire world through ChitBro.
